Ps. Change Variable nyo nalang. Thanks.

Problem:
Create a vector with elements of integer type. Name it as vector_yourInitials. For example, vector_JDC for Juan Dela Cruz.
2. Start by asking the user for the number of elements he/she wishes to store in the vector, then the elements themselves.
3. Display the elements of the vector.
4. Display a menu that provides the user the option to(1) insert a new element, (2) remove an element, (3) delete the entire vector, or (4) quit the program.
a. If a user wants to insert a new element, ask for the position where the new element will be inserted (beginning or end of the vector). b. If a user wants to delete an element, ask whether the user want to remove the first or last element. c. If a user wants to delete the entire vector, do so. d. The program must stop if the user chooses the fourth option.
5. Strictly use functions that are associated with vector to execute these actions.
6. Display the elements of the vector after every action taken. Notify the user if the
vector is already empty.
7. Add important comments. Include your name and section as a comment as well.
8. Submit your source code as C++ (.cpp) or text (.txt) file. Non conformity to this
instruction will invalidate your submission.
